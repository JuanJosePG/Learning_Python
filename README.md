# Learning Python
In this repository, I'm going to upload some simple scripts with those who I'm learning new things about Python. I only learned several functions about Python to can finish my final project degree. But now, I'm learning more about it to improve my level and do useful app (or whatever).

Nowadays, I'm doing the free course of freeCodeCamp: Scientific Computing with Python to have a basic introduction of many things which can do with Python.

At the end of the week, I'll upload all the scripts that I've learned during the week. I hope that if you are reading this, you will have a while to take a look at the scripts and you can leave me any criticism (I hope constructive) that will help me improve.
